**iOS Vs Android**

Currently BLS uses Blackberry Enterprise Servers (BES), version 10, to deploy and operate a fleet of 620 devices in the National Office and the Regions. The fleet of devices in use are Blackberry Q20’s which have been discontinued as of July, 2016. To that end, BLS has decided to move to version 12 of the BES server software to better move to the Apple iOS and/or Android system platforms.

The Android models DTNM tested were the Google Pixel and the Samsung Galaxy S8. Unfortunately, DTNM was not able to test the platform as extensively as the iPhones, but the phones performed adequately. Here are some pro’s and con’s of going with the platform:

Pro
     - The phones tested performed well and are similar to what most people use now.
     - Google has made great strides to lock down their platform against data breaches and infections, and has a roadmap of how they would like patches to be handled by all of their manufacturers.
     - Google recently switched to a file based encryption on phones. Data will be a bit more secure than before.
     
 Con
     -Androids [*comprise 81% of phones infected with malware and viruses*](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/businesses-beware-smartphone-malware-rises-400-in-2016-nokia-reports/). The year before, they comprised 95%.
     -   Even now, all patches are released immediately to Google manufactured phones, but every other manufacturer takes the code, tweaks it, releases to the [*carriers like Verizon*](https://android.gadgethacks.com/news/psa-verizons-shady-dt-ignite-app-is-silently-installing-adware-phones-0175780/) who can add code that decreases your security, and then it is released. Flagship phones get patched fairly quickly (within a week usually) and [*older/cheaper phones can take many, many months*](http://www.droid-life.com/2016/08/16/android-security-updates-suck/).
  -   Google recently rolled out a their file based encryption, instead of the entire disk. This is more secure than their whole disk encryption (https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/07/01/turns_out_breaking_android_fulldisk_encryption_is_easy_with_the_right_code/). Apple has implemented File Based Encryption on all of its phones since iOS 4.0 which was released many years ago. Google appears to think of security as an afterthought.

DTNM also tested several Apple iPhone models and put them through extensive testing. In addition to evaluating the phones here at the National Office, several Regional users participated and sent detailed performance reports. iOS devices were consistantly rated very highly for ease of use and familiarity.

Pro
-   Apple released iOS 10.2.1 one month ago which could be installed on a five year old iPhone 5.
-   Apple employs a much better encryption system than the Android platform provides. The newest iPhone 7 has the best consumer grade encryption available and many government agencies would be unable to break into the phone.
-   iPhone hardware is quality hardware and comes with great support. In addition, they have a large market share in North America so there will always be, “an App for that.”

Con
-  The phones are a bit more expensive and Apple discontinues older models. A new iPhone model only lasts for 2 years.
-  Apple decides when to release patches and is often secretive about new malware, vulnerabilities, and exploits.
-  The iOS adoption would require DTNM keep an iMac on hand. A centralized store for iOS images will help keep the Wi-Fi from being overwhelmed when updates are released.

***So What? ***

iOS devices, and in particular the iPhone 7, have a nigh-impossible-to-crack device encryption in place. Android devices use an encryption standard that is flawed and not as good as Apple already implements. In addition, Android device updates are unneccesarily complicated and convoluted. The sheer number of devices that need to be supported lead to long wait times for updates to be released. Currently, our Blackberry fleet is a little over three years old, and they still receive updates from RIM. Samsung will eventually stop supporting older models, which means a faster upgrade cycle for smartphones, which will increase overall cost.

We would be able to use our smartphones over a longer period of time, while not reducing mobile device security, and spend less time vetting updates for phones across multiple manufacturers - if we go with the iOS solution. Deciding to proceed with Android devices, even with the flagship models, would mean BLS would spend more money to upgrade devices, support a wider range of models due to carrier exclusivity, and spend a ton of time in labor hours vetting and testing device patches.
